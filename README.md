Project by Ananaba Elliot and Therasse Pierre
>>>>>>> b075716... event UI beta

We do that as a final work for our student life.

Here you can found some information about the project.



The idea was: create a smart, efficiant, intuitive, software able on your
computer and on your browser. With our software you gonna be able to synchronise
your group works infos automaticly without have to think about anything.

The only thing you have to do is login on your computer on Drope or your browser
and share your ideas, your info, with all of your staff.

Be sure to work on the latest version of a algorithm, presentation etc.

We are very pround to present to you our last version of Drope(Beta 5)

For security reasons the code didn't contains the upload, download and db class which contain only an upload/download/databese function
